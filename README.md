# Assignment 2 of Native app devolpment

This is my submission for the second assignment of the native app development.
This program implements the Madlibs program as an app in android studio.

## What does it do:

after leaving the introduction screen the user is asked for a series of inputs which can be entered into a an EditText view, these are then collected and assembled into a story and presented to the user after he finishes entering the last word.

The inputs required depend on the randomly chosen story.

Examples:
